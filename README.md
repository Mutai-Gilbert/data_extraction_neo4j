Description

The script retrieves user activity data based on a specified date range. It then calculates the number of posts created by each user within that timeframe and exports the usernames and post counts to an Excel file.

Requirements

- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- neo4j library (pip install neo4j)
- pandas library (pip install pandas)
- openpyxl library (pip install openpyxl)

## Installation

Install the required libraries using pip:

```pip install neo4j pandas openpyxl```

Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install neo4j pandas openpyxl

```
Configuration

Update the following connection details in the script:
uri: The URI of your Neo4j database instance (e.g., bolt://localhost:7687).
user: The username for accessing your Neo4j database.
password: The password for the specified user. Important: Securely store your password using environment variables or a configuration file. Never commit passwords to version control.
Usage

Run the script:

Bash
python your_script_name.py
Use code with caution.

 The script will attempt to connect to your Neo4j database using the provided credentials.

If successful, it will execute a query to retrieve user activity data for the past 7 days (customizable by modifying the WHERE clause in the query).

If data is found, it will create an Excel file named user_post_{current_date}.xlsx within a directory named with the current date (e.g., /content/2024-04-11).

The script will print the path to the saved Excel file.

Customization

Modify the neo4j_query variable to adjust the date range, user properties, or relationships queried.
Change the filename or directory structure for the output Excel file as needed.
Example Usage

# Assuming the script is named user_activity.py and your Neo4j connection details are set

python user_activity.py

# Output (if data is found)
Excel file saved at: /content/2024-04-11/user_post_2024-04-11.xlsx
Disclaimer

Exercise caution when handling database credentials.
Consider error handling for various scenarios (e.g., database connection issues, empty results).
Explore unit testing to ensure code reliability.
Additional Notes

This script provides a basic example of Neo4j data analysis and export.
For more complex use cases, refer to the Neo4j Cypher query language documentation (https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/introduction/).
Securely store sensitive data like passwords outside of the script.
